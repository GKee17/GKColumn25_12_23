        <View style={{flexDirection:'row'}}> <Text style={{flex: 1, flexWrap: 'wrap'}}> With Wimbledon in full swing, people up and down the country have been inspired to get outside and try their own hand at the game. I'm delighted that some of our courts at Oakland Park will be part of the Government’s £30 million tennis court renovation fund, in collaboration with the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA). As part of the investment, the site will be upgraded with a digital gate access system, allowing people to book quickly and easily through the LTA’s online system. It should make it easier than ever to get outside and start playing tennis in Chichester, and I can’t wait to see more people making the most of these brilliant facilities. </p> It’s not just tennis, we’ll also be seeing lots more exciting initiatives as part of the Government’s £300 million investment plan for sports facilities across the country by 2025. Applications for the Swimming Pool Support Fund are next in the pipeline, and I’ll be encouraging local swimming pools to consider getting their applications in with Sport England by the closing date of 11th August. Contact my office if you need any help getting started! </View> </p>

        </div> We’ve also had great news for the Chichester College Group (CCG), following its successful bid under the T Levels Capital Fund. I’m a huge believer in technical and vocational education as a former apprentice myself, and thanks to this £100 million in capital funding, we’ll be seeing 107 new projects delivered across 83 different providers. At the Group, the funding will make a range of T Levels available, including courses in Digital Production and Design, as well as Legal, Finance & Accounting. It’s great young people will have even more choice as they take their next steps in and around Chichester. </p>

        <p>Finally, I want to thank the 16th Royal Artillery for making the special trip to Parliament from Thorney Island. It was a pleasure to join my colleague and Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer for a chat with the regiment on all things politics, as well as the huge strides we’ve made on veterans’ issues in recent years, launching the Veteran’s ID Card programme and, most recently, up to £8 million in support for tackling veterans’ homelessness this year. With Summer recess coming up next week, I look forward to seeing more of you as I make visits across the constituency. Stay tuned for updates across my website and Facebook page!
